### Nix lang

Jump this part if aready know Nix Lang, if don't there is a small concise content of [Nix Lang](https://github.com/tazjin/nix-1p).

If one page is too much to you, the basic is:

- `:` defines a new function, `arg: "Hello ${arg}"`
- that's why we use `=` instaed of `:`, `{ attr-key = "value"; }`
- `;` instead of `,` and they **aren't optional**
- array aren't separated by `,` ie. `[ "some" "value" ]`
